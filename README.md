## reading ; good developer`s mindset 
a good developer should keep in mind that the code will be read by others and its made to help users so he should keep the code as simple and readable as possible, avoiding any misunderstandings for maintenance in the future because it could be done by otheres, simplifing the code can be done by 1.knowing the problems that needs to be solved 2.solve them 3.not overthink about it, excluding deep future predictions and unnecessary assumptions is a key , always remember a good code is a simple one that does what`s needed, and the only way to know that is by testing it, at the end a good developer should have good documentation for his code and should also keep it up with the self learning .
